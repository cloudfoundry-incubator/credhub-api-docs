# credhub-api-docs

To add new sections on the api site, create a new "_name-of-file.md" file in the `includes` directory. Then, add the name of the file to the `includes:` section `index.html.md` file (without the `_` and `.md`).

Changes pushed to this repo will authomatically kick off the pipeline and be uploaded to the website.
