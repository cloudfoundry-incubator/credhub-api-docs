# Permissions

Permissions can be defined for namespaces as well as on explicit credential names. Permissions are additive â€“ if any rule exists authorizing a user to take an action, then the action will be permitted.

actor names must be prefixed with the [authentication type](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/credhub/blob/master/docs/authentication-identities.md#primary-identifiers):  
- mtls-app:APP-GUID (i.e. mtls-app:fdbeb2d4-b601-4a0d-91e8-7e38dde426f7)  
- uaa-user:USER-GUID (i.e. uaa-user:2ae1621a-bb35-4bb7-946a-4761d3b16a04)  
- uaa-client:CLIENT-NAME (i.e. uaa-client:director_to_credhub)  

## Setting/Updating Permissions
This request sets permissions for a path for an actor. You can add permission for a specific credential on a path, as well as all items under a path by using the * syntax.
